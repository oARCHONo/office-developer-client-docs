# PidTagReceivedByAddressType Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Contains the email address type, such as SMTP, for the messaging user who actually receives the message.
  
|Property |Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_RECEIVED_BY_ADDRTYPE, PR_RECEIVED_BY_ADDRTYPE_A, PR_RECEIVED_BY_ADDRTYPE_W  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0075  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_STRING8, PT_UNICODE  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI envelope  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

These properties are examples of the address properties for the messaging user who actually receives the message. They must be set by the incoming transport provider.
  
The address type string can contain only the uppercase alphabetic characters A through Z and the numbers zero through nine. These properties qualify the **PR_RECEIVED_BY_EMAIL_ADDRESS** ([PidTagReceivedByEmailAddress](pidtagreceivedbyemailaddress-canonical-property.md)) property by specifying an address type, such as SMTP, thereby indicating how the address should be constructed.
